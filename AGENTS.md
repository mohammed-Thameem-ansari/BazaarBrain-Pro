# BazaarBrain-Pro â€“ AI Agents

## Agent Architecture

BazaarBrain uses a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in specific business intelligence tasks, working together to provide comprehensive insights for shopkeepers.

## Agent Descriptions

### Intake Agent
Classifies and routes incoming requests (sales logs, financial queries, general business questions) to the appropriate specialized agent. Acts as the intelligent dispatcher for all user interactions.

### Reality Capture Agent
Extracts structured data from unstructured inputs like receipts, voice recordings, and handwritten notes. Uses OCR and speech recognition to convert real-world business data into actionable digital information.

### Simulation Agent
Runs "what-if" scenarios and financial modeling for business decisions. Simulates sales projections, profit margins, and collective bargaining outcomes to help shopkeepers make informed choices.

### Explain Agent
Translates complex AI outputs into simple, actionable insights that shopkeepers can easily understand. Converts technical analysis into practical business recommendations and clear next steps.

### Arbitration Panel Agent
Coordinates collective bargaining simulations by aggregating multiple shopkeeper orders and negotiating with suppliers. Manages group purchasing decisions and ensures fair distribution of benefits.
